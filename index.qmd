title: "Number of People per AP Scholar Award by State"
---

The number of people per AP Scholar award varies tremendously by state. The number of AP Scholar awards was sourced from the AP Data Archive and the state populations was sourced from the American Community Survey 1-Year Data for 2019. The number of people per AP Scholar award for each state was found by dividing the state population by the total number of AP Scholar awards granted to students in that state. Rural states with lower populations tend to have a greater number of people per AP Scholar award.

Note: You can hover the cursor over the states on the plot to display extra information.
