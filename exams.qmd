title: "AP Exams"

This plot visualizes the 2020 AP exams by their mean score and the number of students who took the exam. There appears to be a moderate negative correlation between the mean score of an AP exam and the number of students who took the exam.

Note: You can hover the cursor over the points on the plot to display extra information.

# 'Students': Finding total number of students by adding the number of 1s through 5s (1-5 is the scale on AP tests)
