title: "AP Program Participation (continued)"
---

This page contains four graphs that display the annual AP program participation by year along with a regression line. Again, we can see that the
number of schools offering AP exams and the number of colleges accepting AP credit have a similar growth rate, along with the number of students who took an AP exam and the number of exams administered by AP.

Note: You can hover the cursor over the points on the plot to display extra information.
