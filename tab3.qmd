title: "Colleges and Universities"

These two plots display the top 25 colleges and universities in 2020. Ranking was determined by the total number of students that sent an AP score and the total number of AP scores the college or university received that year. A higher number of students or AP scores received corresponds with a higher ranking.

You can hover the cursor over the points on the plot to display extra information.
