Ranking was determined by the total number of students that sent an AP score and the total number of AP scores the college or university received that year. A higher number of students or AP scores received corresponds with a higher ranking. Obviously, colleges and universities with a larger student body have a greater number of students that have sent an AP score and received a greater number of AP scores than smaller colleges and universities.\nNote: You can hover the cursor over the points on the plot to display extra information."

There are many types of AP Scholar Awards and the quantity of each award is presented in the AP Scholar Awards data, but only the total number of awards was utilized in the map below. Rural states with lower populations tend to have a lower number of AP Scholar Awards per capita.\nNote: You can hover the cursor over the states on the plot to display extra information."

Surprisingly, throughout the years, the top six states with the highest AP exam volumes accounted for more than half of the nationwide exam volume.\nNote: You can hover the cursor over the states on the plot to display extra information.
