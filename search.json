The number of AP Scholar awards was sourced from the AP Data Archive and the state populations was sourced from the American Community Survey 1-Year Data for 2019. The number of people per AP Scholar award for each state was found by dividing the state population by the total number of AP Scholar awards granted to students in that state. Rural states with lower populations tend to have a greater number of people per AP Scholar award.\nNote: You can hover the cursor over the states on the plot to display extra information."

A higher number of students or AP scores received corresponds with a higher ranking. Obviously, colleges and universities with a larger student body have a greater number of students that have sent an AP score and received a greater number of AP scores than smaller colleges and universities.\nNote: You can hover the cursor over the points on the plot to display extra information."

Mapping data was then used to visualize the volume of AP exams by state from 2010 to 2020. Surprisingly, throughout the years, the top six states with the highest AP exam volumes accounted for more than half of the nationwide exam volume.\nNote: You can hover the cursor over the states on the plot to display extra information. Bear in mind that the values displayed while hovering your cursor on the map do not update during animation if the cursor stays in the same location.
